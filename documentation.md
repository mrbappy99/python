# Python

## Strings 

We can define strings using 
single (‘ ‘) or double (“ “) quotes. 

To define a multi-line string, we surround our string with tripe quotes (“””).

We can get individual characters in a string using square brackets []. 

`course = ‘Python for Beginners’ 
course[0] # returns the first character 
course[1] # returns the second character 
course[-1] # returns the first character from the end 
course[-2] # returns the second character from the end
`

## Type conversion

To change string into integer, float(number with decimal) and boolean value

`int()
 float()
 bool()
`
to see the type of string 

`type()`


## Editing

New line

`"\n"`

## Basic arithmatic operation

Sum = `num1+ num2`

Difference = `num1 - num2`

Product = `num1 * num2`

Quotient = `num1 // num2`

Modulus = `num1 % num2`

To find Square of number 
`number ** exponent`




## Math functions

1. 

2. To find the power of any number- 

`pow(base, exponent)`

3. To find square root of any number - 

`from math import sqrt
 sqrt(number)`
